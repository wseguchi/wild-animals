          <h2>Fox</h2>
          <p>
            Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to
            several genera of the family Canidae. They have a flattened skull,
            upright, triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a
            long bushy tail (or brush).
          </p>
          <p>
            Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and
            widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about
            47 recognized subspecies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread
            reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in
            popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established
            pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by
            European settlers to various parts of the New World.

          <h2>Squirrel</h2>
          <p>
            Squirrels are members of the family Sciuridae, a family that
            includes small or medium-size rodents. (whats that?)
          </p>
          <p>
            The squirrel family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels
            (including chipmunks and prairie dogs, among others), and flying
            squirrels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and
            were introduced by humans to Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
            The earliest known fossilized squirrels date from the Eocene epoch,
            and among other living rodent families, the squirrels are most
            closely related to the mountain beaver and to the dormice.

          <h2>Bear</h2>
          <p>
            Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are
            classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are
            widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the
            Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears
            are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe,
            and Asia.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda
            feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are
            omnivorous with varied diets.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their
            young, bears are typically solitary animals. They may be diurnal or
            nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell.

          <h2>Wolf</h2>
          <p>
            The wolf (Canis lupus;[b] pl: wolves), also known as the gray wolf
            or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America.
          </p>
          <p>
            More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized,
            including the dog and dingo, though gray wolves, as popularly
            understood, only comprise naturally-occurring wild subspecies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae, and is
            further distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed
            ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis
            species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce
            fertile hybrids with them. The wolf's fur is usually mottled white,
            brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may
            be nearly all white.
          </p>

          <h2>Monkey</h2>
          <p>
            Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the
            infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are
            counted as monkeys except the apes, which constitutes an incomplete
            paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on
            cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms
            monkeys and simians synonyms in regards to their scope.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are
            species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most
            species are mainly active during the day (diurnal).
          </p>
          <p>
            Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the
            Old World monkeys.

          <h2>Lion</h2>
          <p>
            The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native
            to Africa and India.
          </p>
          <p>
            It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round
            ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females
            and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups
            called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related
            females, and cubs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on
            large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although
            some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to
            hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on
            humans.
